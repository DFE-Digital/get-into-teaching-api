For the purpose of data protection legislation, the DfE is the data controller for the personal data processed as part of The Get Into Teaching Information Service, including the Get School Experience service.\nHow we will use your information\nWe receive and process the personal data you provided when completing either the Get Into Teaching registration form or the Get School Experience service registration form, because you have requested that we provide you with tailored advice and information about teacher training and a career as a teacher, or have requested school experience. These services will help you to make an informed decision about making an application.\n\nSpecifically we will use your data in the following ways:\n•\tThe information you provide in the registration forms (and any subsequent updates made via our helpline, including registration to events) is shared with our Get Into Teaching telephone helpline and web chat service to ensure that they have an accurate picture of your circumstances in order to provide a tailored service and information to you. Any subsequent information you provide to the helpline will also be recorded in order to continue to provide you with a tailored service.\n•\tWe use your contact details to communicate with you by telephone and to send you email, SMS and postal messages, providing you with information about a career in teaching. We may also contact you to gauge your interest in taking part in market research. In each message, you will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from further communications.\n•\tThe information we collect from you (such as your name, contact details and subject preferences) is used for identification, administration, analysis and targeting purposes. This allows us to ensure that public funds are being spent effectively.\n•\tThe information we collect from you may be used to deliver tailored messages on third party platforms, including social media - like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and Google search. Your information will also be used to identify and advertise to people that are similar to you, who may also be interested in our service.\n•\tIf you are using the Get School Experience service, your data will be used to process your request for school experience with the school(s) in question. We will also use it to send out notifications, reminders and feedback questionnaires. We track your progress through this service to improve it for you and future applicants and to ensure public funds are being spent effectively.\nYour personal data, supplied for the purposes of this service, will be used as long as it is deemed necessary. We will delete this information if you request us to do so.\nIf you do not supply us with your personal information then we cannot provide a tailored advice and information service or offer you access to the services available via our website such as booking a Train to Teach event. However, without registering, you can still access general information via the Get into Teaching helpline and website and can complete an application for Initial Teacher Training through UCAS Teacher Training.\n\nThe nature of your personal data we will be using\nThe categories of your data, supplied by you through the registration forms and other interactions with us, that we will be using for this service are personal data such as:\n•\tName\n•\tEmail address\n•\tAddress\n•\tContact telephone number\n•\tDate of birth\n•\tIP Address\nWe will also be collecting non-personal information such as:\n•\tYour teaching preferences\n•\tYour intended training commencement year\n•\tYour qualifications\n•\tAny additional supplementary information you provide during communication with the helpline and/or personal advisers that will help us to aid you in progressing your application and continue to improve our service.\n\nWhy our use of your personal data is lawful\nIn order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation. You have requested to receive this service and therefore, together with this privacy notice (about the use of your personal data), you have agreed to your data being used to deliver the service. However, the condition that we are relying on (once you have agreed to receiving the service) is that under Article 6 (1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) DfE is processing your personal data in the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.\nWho we will make your personal data available to\nWe share your information with trusted partners working to deliver the service under a legal contract on our behalf in order for us to continue to provide you with relevant information about a career in teaching and teacher training or 'the service'. These partners are required to strictly comply with our privacy policies that prohibit them using your personal data for any other purpose.\n\nWe share certain personal data with UCAS Teacher Training, who manage the application system for teacher training. Sharing personal information with UCAS Teacher Training enables us to identify those who have applied for teacher training, thus enabling us to remove the names of these applicants from our mailing lists. We also share data to track your application in order to determine the effectiveness of our service, monitor overall levels of teacher training applicants and improve it for you and future applicants. \nIf you are using the Get School Experience service, we will share some of your personal data to the staff who manage school experience at the school where you've requested school experience. This allows them to process your application and get back to you about your school experience. \nHow long we will keep your personal data\nWe will only keep your personal data for as long as we need it for the purpose(s) of this service, after which point it will be securely destroyed. Please note that under the Data Protection Act, and in compliance with the relevant conditions, we can lawfully keep personal data processed purely for research purposes indefinitely.\nYour data protection rights\nYou have the right:\n•\tto ask us for access to information about you that we hold\n•\tto have your personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete\n•\tto request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing\n•\tto restrict our processing of your personal data (i.e. permitting its storage but no further processing)\n•\tto object to direct marketing (including profiling) and processing for the purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics - but this will mean you no longer can receive the service\n\nPlease contact us at getintoteaching.helpdesk@education.gov.uk and enter Data Protection as a reference regarding any of the rights listed above. For the Data Protection Officer (DPO) please contact us via gov.uk and mark it for the attention of the ‘DPO’.\nIf you need to contact us regarding any of the above rights, please do so via the Get into Teaching site\nFurther information about your data protection rights appears on the Information Commissioner's website\nRight to lodge a complaint\nIf you are unhappy with our use of your personal data, please let us know by contacting getintoteaching.helpdesk@education.gov.uk\nAlternatively, you have the right to raise any concerns with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) via their website.\nLast updated\nWe may need to update this privacy notice periodically, so we recommend that you revisit this information from time to time.

For the purpose of data protection legislation, the DfE is the data controller for the personal data processed as part of The Get Into Teaching Information Service. \r\nHow we will use your information\r\nWe receive and process the personal data you provided when completing the Get Into Teaching website registration form, because you have requested that we provide you with tailored advice and information about teacher training and a career as a teacher. This will help you to make an informed decision about making an application. \r\nSpecifically we will use your data in the following ways: \r\nThe information you provide in the Get Into Teaching registration form (and any subsequent updates to your online profile, including registration to events) is shared with our Get Into Teaching telephone helpline and web chat service to ensure that they have an accurate picture of your preferences and circumstances in order to provide a tailored service and information to you. Any subsequent information you provide to the helpline will also be recorded in order to continue to provide you with a tailored service. \r\nWe use your contact details to communicate with you by telephone and to send you email, SMS and postal messages, providing you with information about a career in teaching. We may also contact you to gauge your interest in taking part in market research. In each message you will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from further communications.\r\nThe information we collect from you (such as your name, contact details and subject preferences) is used for identification, administration, analysis and targeting purposes. We share your information with trusted partners working under a legal contract on our behalf in order for us to continue to provide you with relevant information about a career in teaching and teacher training or ‘the service’. These partners are required to strictly comply with our privacy policies that prohibit them using your personal data for any other purpose.\r\nThe information we collect from you may be used to deliver tailored messages on third party platforms, including social media - like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and Google search. Your information will also be used to identify and advertise to people similar to you, who may also be interested in our service. \r\nWe share certain personal data with UCAS, who manage the application system for teacher training. Sharing personal information with UCAS enables us to identify those who have applied for teacher training, thus enabling us to remove the names of these applicants from our mailing lists. We also share data to track your application in order to determine the effectiveness of our service and improve it for you and future applicants. It also allows us to ensure that public funds are being spent effectively. \r\nYour personal data, supplied for the purposes of this service, will be used as long as it is deemed necessary. We will delete this information if you request us to do so.\r\nIf you do not supply us with your personal information then we cannot provide a tailored advice and information service or offer you access to the services available via our website such as the School Experience Portal.  However, without registering, you can still access general information via the Get into Teaching helpline and website and can complete an application for Initial Teacher Training through UCAS.\r\nThe nature of your personal data we will be using\r\nThe categories of your personal data, supplied by you through the registration form and other interactions with us, that we will be using for this service are: \r\n* Name\r\n* Email address\r\n* Address\r\n* Contact telephone number\r\n* Date of birth\r\n* Teaching subject preferences\r\n* Your intended training commencement year\r\n* Your qualifications\r\n* IP Address\r\n* Additional supplementary information you provide during communication with the helpline and/or personal advisors that will help us to aid you in progressing your application and continue to improve our service.  \r\n\r\nWhy our use of your personal data is lawful\r\nIn order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation.You have requested to receive this service and therefore, together with this privacy notice (about the use of your personal data), you have agreed to your data being used to deliver the service. However, the condition that we are relying on (once you have agreed to receiving the service) is that the Department for Education is carrying out its public interest task in making sure there is a sufficient supply of qualified teachers in England. \r\nWho we will make your personal data available to\r\n\r\nWe sometimes need to make personal data available to other organisations. These include contracted partners (as mentioned above) who help us deliver the service on our behalf.\r\n\r\nYour data will also be used to identify if you have applied for teacher training through UCAS and to monitor overall levels of teacher training applicants. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow long we will keep your personal data\r\n\r\nWe will only keep your personal data for as long as we need it for the purpose(s) of this service, after which point it will be securely destroyed. Please note that under the Data Protection Act, and in compliance with the relevant conditions, we can lawfully keep personal data processed purely for research purposes indefinitely. \r\n\r\nYour data protection rights\r\n\r\nYou have the right:\r\n\r\n* to ask us for access to information about you that we hold \r\n* to have your personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete\r\n* to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing\r\n* to restrict our processing of your personal data (i.e. permitting its storage but no further processing)\r\n* to object to direct marketing (including profiling) and processing for the purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics - but this will mean you no longer can receive the service\r\n\r\nIf you need to contact us regarding any of the above, please do so via the Get into Teaching site at: https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/contact\r\n\r\nFurther information about your data protection rights appears on the Information Commissioner’s website at:\r\nhttps://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/principle-6-rights/.\r\n\r\nViewing and deleting your data and the right to lodge a complaint \r\n\r\nYou have the right to delete your data. You can do this by logging into your profile on the Get Into Teaching website and submitting a deletion request via the ‘my data’ tab on your profile. You can also do this by contacting the helpline on 0800 389 2500. \r\n\r\nIf at any time you would like to view a copy of the data we hold on you, you can do the following: \r\n- View a copy of your website registration and progress tracker data via the ‘my data’ tab on your profile on the Get Into Teaching website. \r\n- If you have interacted with our service via the helpline, Premier Plus advisors or Get Into Teaching events, you can also submit a request to view this additional data via the ‘my data’ tab on your profile on the Get Into Teaching website. \r\n- If you registered with us via the helpline or Get Into Teaching events, or you are having difficulty submitting a request via the website, you can request a copy of all your data by contacting the helpline on 0800 389 2500 or emailing dataprotection@ta-recruit.education.gov.uk. \r\n\r\nIf you are unhappy with our use of your personal data, please let us know by contacting dataprotection@ta-recruit.education.gov.uk. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, you have the right to raise any concerns with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) via their website at https://ico.org.uk/concerns/.\r\n\r\nLast updated\r\n\r\nWe may need to update this privacy notice periodically so we recommend that you revisit this information from time to time. This version was last updated on 21 May 2018.\r\n"

        "Value": "Privacy Notice: Get Into Teaching Information Service\nWho we are\nThis work is being carried out by the Department for Education (DfE). For the purpose of data protection legislation, the DfE is the data controller for the personal data processed as part of The Get Into Teaching Information Service, including the Get School Experience service.\nHow we will use your information\nWe receive and process the personal data you provided when completing either the Get Into Teaching registration form or the Get School Experience service registration form, because you have requested that we provide you with tailored advice and information about teacher training and a career as a teacher, or have requested school experience. These services will help you to make an informed decision about making an application.\n\nSpecifically we will use your data in the following ways:\n•\tThe information you provide in the registration forms (and any subsequent updates made via our helpline, including registration to events) is shared with our Get Into Teaching telephone helpline and web chat service to ensure that they have an accurate picture of your circumstances in order to provide a tailored service and information to you. Any subsequent information you provide to the helpline will also be recorded in order to continue to provide you with a tailored service.\n•\tWe use your contact details to communicate with you by telephone and to send you email, SMS and postal messages, providing you with information about a career in teaching. We may also contact you to gauge your interest in taking part in market research. In each message, you will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from further communications.\n•\tThe information we collect from you (such as your name, contact details and subject preferences) is used for identification, administration, analysis and targeting purposes. This allows us to ensure that public funds are being spent effectively.\n•\tWe will use anonymised data about you to deliver tailored messages on third party platforms, including social media - like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and Google search. Such anonymised data will also be used to identify and advertise to people that are similar to you, who may also be interested in our service.\n•\tIf you are using the Get School Experience service, your data will be used to process your request for school experience with the school(s) in question. We will also use it to send out notifications, reminders and feedback questionnaires. We track your progress through this service to improve it for you and future applicants and to ensure public funds are being spent effectively.\nYour personal data, supplied for the purposes of this service, will be stored for 5 years.\nIf you do not supply us with your personal information then we cannot provide a tailored advice and information service or offer you access to the services available via our website such as booking a Train to Teach event. However, without registering, you can still access general information via the Get into Teaching helpline and website and can complete an application for Initial Teacher Training through UCAS Teacher Training.\n\nThe nature of your personal data we will be using\nThe categories of your data, supplied by you through the registration forms and other interactions with us, that we will be using for this service are personal data such as:\n•\tName\n•\tEmail address\n•\tAddress\n•\tContact telephone number\n•\tDate of birth\n•\tIP Address\nWe will also be collecting non-personal information such as:\n•\tYour teaching preferences\n•\tYour intended training commencement year\n•\tYour qualifications\n•\tAny additional supplementary information you provide during communication with the helpline and/or personal advisers that will help us to aid you in progressing your application and continue to improve our service.\n\nWhy our use of your personal data is lawful\nIn order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation. You have requested to receive this service and therefore, together with this privacy notice (about the use of your personal data), you have agreed to your data being used to deliver the service. However, the condition that we are relying on (once you have agreed to receiving the service) is that under Article 6 (1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) DfE is processing your personal data in the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.\nWho we will make your personal data available to\nWe share your information with trusted partners working to deliver the service under a legal contract on our behalf in order for us to continue to provide you with relevant information about a career in teaching and teacher training or 'the service'. These partners are required to strictly comply with our privacy policies that prohibit them using your personal data for any other purpose.\n\nWe share certain personal data with UCAS Teacher Training, who manage the application system for teacher training. Sharing personal information with UCAS Teacher Training enables us to identify those who have applied for teacher training, thus enabling us to remove the names of these applicants from our mailing lists. We also share data to track your application in order to determine the effectiveness of our service, monitor overall levels of teacher training applicants and improve it for you and future applicants. \nIf you are using the Get School Experience service, we will share some of your personal data to the staff who manage school experience at the school where you've requested school experience. This allows them to process your application and get back to you about your school experience. \nHow long we will keep your personal data\nYour personal data, supplied for the purposes of this service, will be stored for 5 years. We will delete this information if you request us to do so.\nYour data protection rights\nYou have the right:\n•\tto ask us for access to information about you that we hold\n•\tto have your personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete\n•\tto request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing\n•\tto restrict our processing of your personal data (i.e. permitting its storage but no further processing)\n•\tto object to direct marketing (including profiling) and processing for the purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics - but this will mean you no longer can receive the service\n\nPlease contact us at getintoteaching.helpdesk@education.gov.uk and enter Data Protection as a reference regarding any of the rights listed above. For the Data Protection Officer (DPO) please contact us via gov.uk and mark it for the attention of the ‘DPO’.\nIf you need to contact us regarding any of the above rights, please do so via the Get into Teaching site\nFurther information about your data protection rights appears on the Information Commissioner's website\nRight to lodge a complaint\nIf you are unhappy with our use of your personal data, please let us know by contacting getintoteaching.helpdesk@education.gov.uk\nAlternatively, you have the right to raise any concerns with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) via their website.\nLast updated\nWe may need to update this privacy notice periodically, so we recommend that you revisit this information from time to time. This version was last updated on 14 January 2020.\nWe use cookies to make our services easy, useful and reliable. Find out more on how we use cookies."
