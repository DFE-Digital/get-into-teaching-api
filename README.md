# Get into Teaching API

> Provides a RESTful API for integrating with the Get into Teaching CRM.

The Get into Teaching (GIT) API sits in front of the GIT CRM, which uses the [Microsoft Dynamics365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/) platform (the [Customer Engagement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/overview) module is used for storing Candidate information and the [Marketing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/marketing/developer/using-events-api) module for managing Events).

The GIT API aims to provide:

- Simple, task-based RESTful APIs.
- Message queueing (while the GIT CRM is offline for updates).
- Validation to ensure consistency across services writing to the GIT CRM.

## Getting Started

The API is an ASP.NET Core web application; to get up and running clone the repository and open `GetIntoTeachingApi.sln` in Visual Studio.

When the application runs in development it will open the Swagger documentation by default.

### Documentation

[Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore) is used for generating Swagger documentation. We use the swagger-ui middleware to expose interactive documentation when the application runs.

We also use the [MicroElements.Swashbuckle.FluentValidation](https://github.com/micro-elements/MicroElements.Swashbuckle.FluentValidation) package to make Swashbuckle aware of the FluentValidation classes, so that additional validation meta data gets displayed alongside model attributes.

### Validation

[FluentValidation](https://fluentvalidation.net/) is used for validating the various models. The validators are registered at startup, so validating incoming payloads that have a corresponding validator is as simple as calling `ModelState.IsValid`.

### Testing

[XUnit](https://xunit.net/) is used for testing; all tests can be found in the `GetIntoTeachingTests` project. We also use [Moq](https://github.com/Moq/moq4/wiki/Quickstart) for mocking any dependencies and [FluentAssertions](https://fluentassertions.com) for assertions.

The unit tests take the convention:

```
public void UnitOfWork_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior()
{
    // arrange

    // act

    // assert
}
```
